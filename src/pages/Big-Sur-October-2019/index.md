Exploring the dirt backroads on a single-night adventure accompanied by my girlfriend, and favorite hooligan. We rode down from San Francisco in a truck with 2 dual sports and an 1190 Adventure. We parked the truck near a pullout near Nacimiento Road on Hwy 1 and spent the day erxploring on the bikes in the expansive Big Sur wilderness. We spent the night moto-camping on a hilltop overlooking the Pacific and enjoyed some whiskey by the sunset.
