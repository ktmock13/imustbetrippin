We found snow in summer! From South Bay, we ventured to the summit of Mt Lassen and camped near Manzanita Lake. This was by far the coldest trip to-date, especially with no heater. We brought a large down quilty to keep us warm. After Lassen we headed to the big dam near Shasta lake. There, we found a pretty cool OHV and messed around on the trails and had lunch before heading back to the bay-area.
