We return to Jawbone! This time with more bikes and less guns. We rode the bikes through the canyons, into REd Rock State Park through mines and steep rock faces. After some major crashes on day 1, we set out on day 2 into a sand bowl which took all day to heave the bikes out of. Rescue missions always make for better stories.
