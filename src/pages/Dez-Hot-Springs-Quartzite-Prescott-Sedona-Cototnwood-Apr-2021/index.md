We set out for AZ for the week of Easter. We spent night 1 at a rennovated motel/spa in Desrert Hot Springs CA. Night 2 had us in the vanlife-famous Quartzite AZ. Joining up with Family the next day in Sedona we visited local attractions such as Jerome (mining ghost-town) Schnebly hill, Tuzigoot, and Monteczuma's Castle NP. Along the way Frank and I had an epic dual sport ride among a few side-by-sides. On the way back to CA we took Rt 66 and camped near Amboy Crater.
