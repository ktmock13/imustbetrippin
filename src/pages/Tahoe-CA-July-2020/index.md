This was a quick 2-night trip in the (mostly) completed van. We made some wrong turns coming into Boca resevoir and ended up testing the van's offroading abilities. Eventually we found our site at Boca Spring and spotted some great trails to ride in a future trip. The next day we spent hiking the Horsetail Falls and paddleboarding in south of Lake Tahoe. We camped at a private campground in South Lake.
