This was a single-night trip. We just picked up the van for our upcoming build, so we went out to some BLM land near Lake Berryessa to test it out. We we joined by some friends and did some light dirt riding with the WR250R (the Honda wouldn't start, sigh). We wpent the evening overlooking some rugged terrain and enjoying some brews. It was quite pleasant!
