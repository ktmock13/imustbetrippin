We started our big NW tour by boondocking on the shore of Lake Shasta. We found some dispersed camping and spent the evening paddling on the lake.

Next, we headed north to Crater lake and jumped off some cliffs, then settled at our campground on Diamond Lake. The next morning we headed across the volcanic wasteland of eastern Oregon and ended in Boise for the a nice dinner in the evening.

Day 4 has us traversing Idaho and stopping along the snake river to take in the sights. We cut through Montana and reach our farthest destination, Grant Village Campground in Yellowstone National Park. We spend a few days in Yellowstone visiting geysers and paddleboarding on bubbling lakes.

Day 6 brings us to Jackson Hole resort where we try our hands at downhill mountain biking. After a big wipeout, we head out in search of a dispersed campsite on the Palisades Resivoir just over the Idaho border. The mozzys were out in full force so we spent the night watching movies and cooking in the van.

Halfway home, the next night we relax in a cozy hotel in Salt Lake City after a night of bar hopping in the city. The next day was a big driving day which landed us safely back in San Jose. What a trip!
