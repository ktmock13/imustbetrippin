On this routine Tahoe trip, we camped on the western shores in the van. We took the truck part way up the Rubicon but we (I) got too scared of scratching that pretty blue paint and turned it around. The last few days were spent at camp and doing bush plane lessons out of Truckee airport into the backcountry.
