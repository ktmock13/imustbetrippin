Joined by our friend and his pup, we blasted up the west coast of CA. Winding through weird little towns in Mendocino, we camped just north of Redwood NP. After that, we pressed on to Olympic Natl Park for night 2. While in the NP, we explored rainforests, coastlines, and natural hot springs in the forest. It rained the whole time and the two poodle breeds were mud soaked most of the time. The adversity made the trip more fun IMO.
