    <h3>Intro</h3>
    <p>
      We wanted a project bike to work on over the pandemic to learn about
      restoration and engines.
    </p>
    <h3>Buying and discovering issues</h3>
    <p>
      When considering which bike we would chose to restore, a few things were
      important to us. First, we wanted something old and simple since this we
      were first timers and older bikes usually have tons of literature to
      reference. Next was coolness factor and uniqueness. We wanted something
      that would turn heads, or at least was uncommon enough to make it special.
      Lastly, the bike we chose had to be in somewhat good condition. Lots of
      rust, missing parts, user modifications were detractors in our search. We
      landed on a bike that we feel checked all the boxes, a 1986 Honda TLR200
      Reflex. This bike was based on the super popular 200cc air cooled platform
      Honda made for decades, but this particular model was only produced for 2
      years. It is a trails/dual-sport hybrid bike. Its small, playful, but also
      fully street legal; truly a class of its own.
    </p>
    <p>
      We bought it for about $1300 from an older gentleman who had it in his
      shed for years. First impressions were that it was in good original form,
      but had some seemingly minor technical issues which would keep us
      entertained to troubleshoot. Turns out these issues were a little more
      involved that we originally thought. The bike would start, idle high, ran
      through the gears, but wouldn't stay running for long so the test ride was
      mostly on a cold engine. I figured it would be mostly a cleaning and
      tuning exercise until we got home and realized the warm gearbox wouldn't
      shift to second no matter how hard we tried. Damn.
    </p>
    <h3>Troubleshooting and planning</h3>
    <p>
      Two things stood out in this repair, the engine being out of tune, and the
      tricky gearbox. Before diagnosing the gearbox, I wanted to figure out if
      there were any major issues that caused the engine to run poorly. I
      replaced the fuel, checked the compression, replaced the carb entirely
      (cheap), tuned the valves to spec, replaced the air filter and checked the
      exhaust for leaks. All of these thing complete, I could get the engine
      running fairly solid. This was confidence I needed in the bike to diagnose
      the gearbox. New oil and a thorough external cleaning didn’t seem to help
      the shifting stickiness. After much research I concluded that it was
      likely a bent shifter fork, which is a big job to fix since this part is
      buried in the lower portions of the engine. I figured since this would
      required a complete disassembly to mend, that I would refurbish all the
      internal wear items while I was at it. So I put a huge eBay order in for
      piston rings, gaskets, crank case splitter, flywheel puller, replacement
      transmission parts, and most importantly the Clymer Manual for the TLR200
    </p>
    <h3>Engine Teardown and Rebuild</h3>
    <p>
      As this is a bit overwhelming at first, the plan was to work through a few
      paragraphs at a time (1hr work) a few evenings of the week. To make sure I
      didn’t end up with a random pile of scraps, I got a project cart and a
      bunch of small organizer bins from Harbor Freight to keep everything tidy
      between working sessions. First I removed the engine from the frame. Then,
      bit by bit, broke down the engine from the top down, simply removing and
      filing away the parts as I went. Eventually, I got all the way down to
      splitting the bottom end and inspecting the shifter forks, and
      transmission. Everything seemed to look ok but I replaced the suspected
      parts just in case. Now that I had an exploded engine, I took a year off
      the project to build an adventure van and travel the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      After spending 6 months disassembled, I was really glad to have the Clymer
      manual to help me through reassembly. I reassembled the bottom end with
      fresh gaskets. We then descaled the carbon buildup and made the internals
      look factory fresh before replacing the piston rings and re assembling the
      cylinder and head. Now that the engine was totally refreshed on the
      inside, I thought it could use a fresh outside. I used Play Doh to mask
      all of the bolt heads, exposed shafts, and bare metal surfaces before
      painting the entire engine with high-heat semi-gloss enamel. This made the
      engine look brand new and hopefully it would work that way too.
