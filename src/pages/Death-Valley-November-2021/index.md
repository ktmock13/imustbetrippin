New bikes! I test out the KTM 500 while my friend tests the Husky 500. Day 1 we traverse the surrounding area of Lee Flat in Death Valley and take turns dumping our bikes on "death hill." Day 2, we take a 70mi round trip to the top of mountains via goat trails, ghost towns, and dried river washes. Each night we party and go on jaunts in the trucks. DV proveds again and again to be the best setting for our shenanigans.
