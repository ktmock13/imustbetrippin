For independence day, we camped along the Truckee river near Tahoe. We got up to some riding in the state forests near the Rubicon trail, and summited our ride on Ellis peak and some of the best trails we've ever ridden. The following days consisted of a lot of partiying on the Truckee river and a few more rides. On the last day while speeding down forest roads we almost collided with a huge black bear!
