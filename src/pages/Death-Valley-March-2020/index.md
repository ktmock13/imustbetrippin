Second annual Death Valley trip. On this one, we are a group of 8 people, across 5 trucks and 6 dual-sports. We camp on BLM land where we find an abandoned cabin, sombreros, and huge sand dunes. We spent spent 4 nights in the desert and spent most evenings exploring the surrounding area on the bikes. This was our last hoorah before the 2020 quarantine.
