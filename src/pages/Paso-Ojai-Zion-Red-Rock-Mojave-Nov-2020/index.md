On a solo mission to the North Coast, I spent a night outisde a friend's house stealth camping in Suasilito CA. Then, I headed up 101 through hours of weird roadside attractions until I pulled off near Humboldt State Park. I skidded the van through muddy mountains roads until I reached the Mendocno Cape where I spent the night on the most western point of the contiguous USA. The next morning I weaved through Zebra Farms and overturned cars in the woods of Mendocino County and made it back to the bay in a long day of driving.
