This follow-up trip is a solo exploration of the Tahoe National Forest. Pretty straight-forward trail riding fun! Spent the night in the Natl Forest near Boca Resevoir. The next day I borrowed a mountain bike and hit up the Corral Trails near South Lake. Sidewinder was my favorite! I spent the second night on Fallen Leaf Lake.
