Our second trip of to Yosemite of the season. We are joined by some family who have never seen the Sierras. We hiked 7 miles round trip to see the Grizzly Giant Sequioa in the Mariposa grove. We (including granny in her 80s!) were submitted to a healthy amount of cold rain on the hike out. We all agree it was worth the effort/suffering to be in the precence of the giant sequioas.
